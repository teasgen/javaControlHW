This question would have been a duplicate if it was easily detected. I kept on googling and searching with different search queries until I got to arghtype's answer on this SO page.
The answer suggested you specifically build the project with maven goal. Intellij has a maven projects window on the left side of the main window which is usually minimized.
When you click and the maven project window opens
drop down the lifecycle and double click clean.
when cleaning is done double click again on the package.
That's all...check the target folder, you will see the jar file(s).
